.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the standard command interpreter for the system.
The current version of
.Nm
is in the process of being changed to conform with the
.Tn POSIX
1003.2 and 1003.2a specifications for the shell (Near).
This version has many
features which make it appear similar in some respects to the Bash shell,
but it is not a Bash shell clone (see
.Xr sh 1 ) .
Only features designated by
.Tn POSIX ,
plus a few Berkeley extensions, are being incorporated into this shell (Some of them).
This man page is not intended
to be a tutorial or a complete specification of the shell
and SOME OF THE FEATURES treated in this document are
implemented and OTHERS are in progress.
.Ss Overview
The shell is a command that reads lines from either a file or the
terminal, interprets them, and generally executes other commands.
It is the program that is running when a user logs into the system
(although a user can select a different shell with the
.Xr chsh 1
command).
The shell implements a language that has flow control
constructs, a macro facility that provides a variety of features in
addition to data storage, along with built in history and line editing
capabilities.
It incorporates many features to aid interactive use and
has the advantage that the interpretative language is common to both
interactive and non-interactive use (shell scripts).
That is, commands
can be typed directly to the running shell or can be put into a file and
the file can be executed directly by the shell.
.Ss Invocation
If no args are present and if the standard input of the shell
is connected to a terminal (or if the
.Fl i
flag is set),
and the
.Fl c
option is not present, the shell is considered an interactive shell.
An interactive shell generally prompts before each command and handles
programming and command errors differently (as described below).
When first starting,
the shell inspects argument 0, and if it begins with a dash
.Sq - ,
the shell is also considered
a login shell.
This is normally done automatically by the system
when the user first logs in.
A login shell first reads commands
from the files
.Pa /etc/profile
and
.Pa .profile
if they exist.
If the environment variable
.Ev ENV
is set on entry to an interactive shell, or is set in the
.Pa .profile
of a login shell, the shell next reads
commands from the file named in
.Ev ENV .
Therefore, a user should place commands that are to be executed only at
login time in the
.Pa .profile
file, and commands that are executed for every interactive shell inside the
.Ev ENV
file.
To set the
.Ev ENV
variable to some file, place the following line in your
.Pa .profile
of your home directory
.Pp
.Dl ENV=$HOME/.shinit; export ENV
.Pp
substituting for
.Dq .shinit
any filename you wish.
.Pp
If command line arguments besides the options have been specified, then
the shell treats the first argument as the name of a file from which to
read commands (a shell script), and the remaining arguments are set as the
positional parameters of the shell ($1, $2, etc).
Otherwise, the shell
reads commands from its standard input.
.Ss Argument List Processing
All of the single letter options that have a corresponding name can be
used as an argument to the
.Fl o
option.
The set
.Fl o
name is provided next to the single letter option in
the description below.
Specifying a dash
.Dq -
turns the option on, while using a plus
.Dq +
disables the option.
The following options can be set from the command line or
with the
.Ic set
builtin (described later).
.Bl -tag -width aaaallexportfoo -offset indent
.It Fl a Em allexport
Export all variables assigned to.
.It Fl c
Read commands from the
.Ar command_string
operand instead of from the standard input.
Special parameter 0 will be set from the
.Ar command_name
operand and the positional parameters ($1, $2, etc.)
set from the remaining argument operands.
.It Fl C Em noclobber
Don't overwrite existing files with
.Dq \*[Gt] .
.It Fl e Em errexit
If not interactive, exit immediately if any untested command fails.
The exit status of a command is considered to be
explicitly tested if the command is used to control an
.Ic if ,
.Ic elif ,
.Ic while ,
or
.Ic until ;
or if the command is the left hand operand of an
.Dq &&
or
.Dq ||
operator.
.It Fl f Em noglob
Disable pathname expansion.
.It Fl n Em noexec
If not interactive, read commands but do not execute them.
This is useful for checking the syntax of shell scripts.
.It Fl u Em nounset
Write a message to standard error when attempting to expand a variable
that is not set, and if the shell is not interactive, exit immediately.
.It Fl v Em verbose
The shell writes its input to standard error as it is read.
Useful for debugging.
.It Fl x Em xtrace
Write each command to standard error (preceded by a
.Sq +\  )
before it is executed.
Useful for debugging.
.It Fl I Em ignoreeof
Ignore EOF's from input when interactive.
.It Fl i Em interactive
Force the shell to behave interactively.
.It Fl l
Make dash act as if it had been invoked as a login shell.
.It Fl m Em monitor
Turn on job control (set automatically when interactive).
.It Fl s Em stdin
Read commands from standard input (set automatically if no file arguments
are present).
This option has no effect when set after the shell has
already started running (i.e. with
.Ic set ) .
.It Fl V Em vi
Enable the built-in
.Xr vi 1
command line editor (disables
.Fl E
if it has been set).
.It Fl E Em emacs
Enable the built-in
.Xr emacs 1
command line editor (disables
.Fl V
if it has been set).
.It Fl b Em notify
Enable asynchronous notification of background job completion.
(UNIMPLEMENTED for 4.4alpha)

.Ss Lexical Structure
The shell reads input in terms of lines from a file and breaks it up into
words at whitespace (blanks and tabs), and at certain sequences of
characters that are special to the shell called
.Dq operators .
There are two types of operators: control operators and redirection
operators (their meaning is discussed later).
Following is a list of operators:
.Bl -ohang -offset indent
.It "Control operators:"
.Dl &  &&  \&(  \&)  \&;  ;; | || \*[Lt]newline\*[Gt]
.It "Redirection operators:"
.Dl \*[Lt]  \*[Gt]  \*[Gt]|  \*[Lt]\*[Lt]  \*[Gt]\*[Gt]  \*[Lt]&  \*[Gt]&  \*[Lt]\*[Lt]-  \*[Lt]\*[Gt]
.El
.Ss Quoting
Quoting is used to remove the special meaning of certain characters or
words to the shell, such as operators, whitespace, or keywords.
There are three types of quoting: matched single quotes,
matched double quotes, and backslash.
.Ss Backslash
A backslash preserves the literal meaning of the following
character, with the exception of
.Aq newline .
A backslash preceding a
.Aq newline
is treated as a line continuation.
.Ss Single Quotes
Enclosing characters in single quotes preserves the literal meaning of all
the characters (except single quotes, making it impossible to put
single-quotes in a single-quoted string).
.Ss Double Quotes
Enclosing characters within double quotes preserves the literal
meaning of all characters except dollarsign
.Pq $ ,
backquote
.Pq ` ,
and backslash
.Pq \e .
The backslash inside double quotes is historically weird, and serves to
quote only the following characters:
.Dl $  `  \*q  \e  \*[Lt]newline\*[Gt] .
Otherwise it remains literal.
.Ss Reserved Words
Reserved words are words that have special meaning to the
shell and are recognized at the beginning of a line and
after a control operator.
The following are reserved words:
.Bl -column while while while while while -offset indent
.It ! Ta elif Ta fi Ta while Ta case
.It else Ta for Ta then Ta { Ta }
.It do Ta done Ta until Ta if Ta esac
.El
.Pp
Their meaning is discussed later.
.Ss Aliases
An alias is a name and corresponding value set using the
.Xr alias 1
builtin command.
Whenever a reserved word may occur (see above),
and after checking for reserved words, the shell
checks the word to see if it matches an alias.
If it does, it replaces it in the input stream with its value.
For example, if there is an alias called
.Dq lf
with the value
.Dq "ls -F" ,
then the input:
.Pp
.Dl lf foobar Aq return
.Pp
would become
.Pp
.Dl ls -F foobar Aq return
.Pp
