.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the standard command interpreter for the system.
The current version of
.Nm
is in the process of being changed to conform with the
.Tn POSIX
1003.2 and 1003.2a specifications for the shell (Near).
This version has many
features which make it appear similar in some respects to the Bash shell,
but it is not a Bash shell clone (see
.Xr sh 1 ) .
Only features designated by
.Tn POSIX ,
plus a few Berkeley extensions, are being incorporated into this shell (Some of them).
This man page is not intended
to be a tutorial or a complete specification of the shell
and SOME OF THE FEATURES treated in this document are
implemented and OTHERS are in progress.
.Ss Overview
The shell is a command that reads lines from either a file or the
terminal, interprets them, and generally executes other commands.
It is the program that is running when a user logs into the system
(although a user can select a different shell with the
.Xr chsh 1
command).
The shell implements a language that has flow control
constructs, a macro facility that provides a variety of features in
addition to data storage, along with built in history and line editing
capabilities.
It incorporates many features to aid interactive use and
has the advantage that the interpretative language is common to both
interactive and non-interactive use (shell scripts).
That is, commands
can be typed directly to the running shell or can be put into a file and
the file can be executed directly by the shell.
.Ss Invocation
If no args are present and if the standard input of the shell
is connected to a terminal (or if the
.Fl i
flag is set),
and the
.Fl c
option is not present, the shell is considered an interactive shell.
An interactive shell generally prompts before each command and handles
programming and command errors differently (as described below).
When first starting,
the shell inspects argument 0, and if it begins with a dash
.Sq - ,
the shell is also considered
a login shell.
This is normally done automatically by the system
when the user first logs in.
A login shell first reads commands
from the files
.Pa /etc/profile
and
.Pa .profile
if they exist.
If the environment variable
.Ev ENV
is set on entry to an interactive shell, or is set in the
.Pa .profile
of a login shell, the shell next reads
commands from the file named in
.Ev ENV .
Therefore, a user should place commands that are to be executed only at
login time in the
.Pa .profile
file, and commands that are executed for every interactive shell inside the
.Ev ENV
file.
To set the
.Ev ENV
variable to some file, place the following line in your
.Pa .profile
of your home directory
.Pp
.Dl ENV=$HOME/.shinit; export ENV
.Pp
substituting for
.Dq .shinit
any filename you wish.
.Pp
If command line arguments besides the options have been specified, then
the shell treats the first argument as the name of a file from which to
read commands (a shell script), and the remaining arguments are set as the
positional parameters of the shell ($1, $2, etc).
Otherwise, the shell
reads commands from its standard input.
.Ss Argument List Processing
All of the single letter options that have a corresponding name can be
used as an argument to the
.Fl o
option.
The set
.Fl o
name is provided next to the single letter option in
the description below.
Specifying a dash
.Dq -
turns the option on, while using a plus
.Dq +
disables the option.
The following options can be set from the command line or
with the
.Ic set
builtin (described later).
.Bl -tag -width aaaallexportfoo -offset indent
.It Fl a Em allexport
Export all variables assigned to.
.It Fl c
Read commands from the
.Ar command_string
operand instead of from the standard input.
Special parameter 0 will be set from the
.Ar command_name
operand and the positional parameters ($1, $2, etc.)
set from the remaining argument operands.
.It Fl C Em noclobber
Don't overwrite existing files with
.Dq \*[Gt] .
.It Fl e Em errexit
If not interactive, exit immediately if any untested command fails.
The exit status of a command is considered to be
explicitly tested if the command is used to control an
.Ic if ,
.Ic elif ,
.Ic while ,
or
.Ic until ;
or if the command is the left hand operand of an
.Dq &&
or
.Dq ||
operator.
.It Fl f Em noglob
Disable pathname expansion.
.It Fl n Em noexec
If not interactive, read commands but do not execute them.
This is useful for checking the syntax of shell scripts.
.It Fl u Em nounset
Write a message to standard error when attempting to expand a variable
that is not set, and if the shell is not interactive, exit immediately.
.It Fl v Em verbose
The shell writes its input to standard error as it is read.
Useful for debugging.
.It Fl x Em xtrace
Write each command to standard error (preceded by a
.Sq +\  )
before it is executed.
Useful for debugging.
.It Fl I Em ignoreeof
Ignore EOF's from input when interactive.
.It Fl i Em interactive
Force the shell to behave interactively.
.It Fl l
Make dash act as if it had been invoked as a login shell.
.It Fl m Em monitor
Turn on job control (set automatically when interactive).
.It Fl s Em stdin
Read commands from standard input (set automatically if no file arguments
are present).
This option has no effect when set after the shell has
already started running (i.e. with
.Ic set ) .
.It Fl V Em vi
Enable the built-in
.Xr vi 1
command line editor (disables
.Fl E
if it has been set).
.It Fl E Em emacs
Enable the built-in
.Xr emacs 1
command line editor (disables
.Fl V
if it has been set).
.It Fl b Em notify
Enable asynchronous notification of background job completion.
(UNIMPLEMENTED for 4.4alpha)
.El
.Ss Lexical Structure
The shell reads input in terms of lines from a file and breaks it up into
words at whitespace (blanks and tabs), and at certain sequences of
characters that are special to the shell called
.Dq operators .
There are two types of operators: control operators and redirection
operators (their meaning is discussed later).
Following is a list of operators:
.Bl -ohang -offset indent
.It "Control operators:"
.Dl &  &&  \&(  \&)  \&;  ;; | || \*[Lt]newline\*[Gt]
.It "Redirection operators:"
.Dl \*[Lt]  \*[Gt]  \*[Gt]|  \*[Lt]\*[Lt]  \*[Gt]\*[Gt]  \*[Lt]&  \*[Gt]&  \*[Lt]\*[Lt]-  \*[Lt]\*[Gt]
.El
.Ss Quoting
Quoting is used to remove the special meaning of certain characters or
words to the shell, such as operators, whitespace, or keywords.
There are three types of quoting: matched single quotes,
matched double quotes, and backslash.
.Ss Backslash
A backslash preserves the literal meaning of the following
character, with the exception of
.Aq newline .
A backslash preceding a
.Aq newline
is treated as a line continuation.
.Ss Single Quotes
Enclosing characters in single quotes preserves the literal meaning of all
the characters (except single quotes, making it impossible to put
single-quotes in a single-quoted string).
.Ss Double Quotes
Enclosing characters within double quotes preserves the literal
meaning of all characters except dollarsign
.Pq $ ,
backquote
.Pq ` ,
and backslash
.Pq \e .
The backslash inside double quotes is historically weird, and serves to
quote only the following characters:
.Dl $  `  \*q  \e  \*[Lt]newline\*[Gt] .
Otherwise it remains literal.
.Ss Reserved Words
Reserved words are words that have special meaning to the
shell and are recognized at the beginning of a line and
after a control operator.
The following are reserved words:
.Bl -column while while while while while -offset indent
.It ! Ta elif Ta fi Ta while Ta case
.It else Ta for Ta then Ta { Ta }
.It do Ta done Ta until Ta if Ta esac
.El
.Pp
Their meaning is discussed later.
.Ss Aliases
An alias is a name and corresponding value set using the
.Xr alias 1
builtin command.
Whenever a reserved word may occur (see above),
and after checking for reserved words, the shell
checks the word to see if it matches an alias.
If it does, it replaces it in the input stream with its value.
For example, if there is an alias called
.Dq lf
with the value
.Dq "ls -F" ,
then the input:
.Pp
.Dl lf foobar Aq return
.Pp
would become
.Pp
.Dl ls -F foobar Aq return
.Pp
Aliases provide a convenient way for naive users to create shorthands for
commands without having to learn how to create functions with arguments.
They can also be used to create lexically obscure code.
This use is discouraged.
.Ss Commands
The shell interprets the words it reads according to a language, the
specification of which is outside the scope of this man page (refer to the
BNF in the
.Tn POSIX
1003.2 document).
Essentially though, a line is read and if the first
word of the line (or after a control operator) is not a reserved word,
then the shell has recognized a simple command.
Otherwise, a complex
command or some other special construct may have been recognized.
.Ss Simple Commands
If a simple command has been recognized, the shell performs
the following actions:
.Bl -enum -offset indent
.It
Leading words of the form
.Dq name=value
are stripped off and assigned to the environment of the simple command.
Redirection operators and their arguments (as described below) are
stripped off and saved for processing.
.It
The remaining words are expanded as described in
the section called
.Dq Expansions ,
and the first remaining word is considered the command name and the
command is located.
The remaining words are considered the arguments of the command.
If no command name resulted, then the
.Dq name=value
variable assignments recognized in item 1 affect the current shell.
.It
Redirections are performed as described in the next section.
.El
.Ss Redirections
Redirections are used to change where a command reads its input or sends
its output.
In general, redirections open, close, or duplicate an
existing reference to a file.
The overall format used for redirection is:
.Pp
.Dl [n] Va redir-op Ar file
.Pp
where
.Va redir-op
is one of the redirection operators mentioned previously.
Following is a list of the possible redirections.
The
.Bq n
is an optional number, as in
.Sq 3
(not
.Sq Bq 3 ) ,
that refers to a file descriptor.
.Bl -tag -width aaabsfiles -offset indent
.It [n] Ns \*[Gt] file
Redirect standard output (or n) to file.
.It [n] Ns \*[Gt]| file
Same, but override the
.Fl C
option.
.It [n] Ns \*[Gt]\*[Gt] file
Append standard output (or n) to file.
.It [n] Ns \*[Lt] file
Redirect standard input (or n) from file.
.It [n1] Ns \*[Lt]& Ns n2
Duplicate standard input (or n1) from file descriptor n2.
.It [n] Ns \*[Lt]&-
Close standard input (or n).
.It [n1] Ns \*[Gt]& Ns n2
Duplicate standard output (or n1) to n2.
.It [n] Ns \*[Gt]&-
Close standard output (or n).
.It [n] Ns \*[Lt]\*[Gt] file
Open file for reading and writing on standard input (or n).
.El
.Pp
The following redirection is often called a
.Dq here-document .
.Bl -item -offset indent
.It
.Li [n]\*[Lt]\*[Lt] delimiter
.Dl here-doc-text ...
.Li delimiter
.El
.Pp
All the text on successive lines up to the delimiter is saved away and
made available to the command on standard input, or file descriptor n if
it is specified.
If the delimiter as specified on the initial line is
quoted, then the here-doc-text is treated literally, otherwise the text is
subjected to parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic
expansion (as described in the section on
.Dq Expansions ) .
If the operator is
.Dq \*[Lt]\*[Lt]-
instead of
.Dq \*[Lt]\*[Lt] ,
then leading tabs in the here-doc-text are stripped.
.Ss Search and Execution
There are three types of commands: shell functions, builtin commands, and
normal programs -- and the command is searched for (by name) in that order.
They each are executed in a different way.
.Pp
When a shell function is executed, all of the shell positional parameters
(except $0, which remains unchanged) are set to the arguments of the shell
function.
The variables which are explicitly placed in the environment of
the command (by placing assignments to them before the function name) are
made local to the function and are set to the values given.
Then the command given in the function definition is executed.
The positional parameters are restored to their original values
when the command completes.
This all occurs within the current shell.
.Pp
Shell builtins are executed internally to the shell, without spawning a
new process.
.Pp
Otherwise, if the command name doesn't match a function or builtin, the
command is searched for as a normal program in the file system (as
described in the next section).
When a normal program is executed, the shell runs the program,
passing the arguments and the environment to the program.
If the program is not a normal executable file (i.e., if it does
not begin with the "magic number" whose
.Tn ASCII
representation is "#!", so
.Xr execve 2
returns
.Er ENOEXEC
then) the shell will interpret the program in a subshell.
The child shell will reinitialize itself in this case,
so that the effect will be as if a
new shell had been invoked to handle the ad-hoc shell script, except that
the location of hashed commands located in the parent shell will be
remembered by the child.
.Pp
Note that previous versions of this document and the source code itself
misleadingly and sporadically refer to a shell script without a magic
number as a "shell procedure".
.Ss Path Search
When locating a command, the shell first looks to see if it has a shell
function by that name.
Then it looks for a builtin command by that name.
If a builtin command is not found, one of two things happen:
.Bl -enum
.It
Command names containing a slash are simply executed without performing
any searches.
.It
The shell searches each entry in
.Ev PATH
in turn for the command.
The value of the
.Ev PATH
variable should be a series of entries separated by colons.
Each entry consists of a directory name.
The current directory may be indicated
implicitly by an empty directory name, or explicitly by a single period.
.El
.Ss Command Exit Status
Each command has an exit status that can influence the behaviour
of other shell commands.
The paradigm is that a command exits
with zero for normal or success, and non-zero for failure,
error, or a false indication.
The man page for each command
should indicate the various exit codes and what they mean.
Additionally, the builtin commands return exit codes, as does
an executed shell function.
